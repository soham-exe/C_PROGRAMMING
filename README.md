# üß† C Programming Practice

Welcome to my C Programming Repository!  
This repository contains a collection of C programs that I‚Äôve written while learning and practicing the fundamentals of C programming ‚Äî starting from the very basics and gradually moving to more advanced topics.

## üìò About
This repo is meant for:
- Strengthening my understanding of C programming concepts.
- Building a strong foundation in logic development.
- Keeping track of my learning progress over time.

Each folder or file focuses on a specific concept or exercise ‚Äî from simple programs like printing numbers or checking even/odd, to loops, arrays, functions, and more.

## üß© Topics Covered (So Far)
- Basic Input/Output  
- Conditional Statements (if, else, switch)  
- Loops (for, while, do-while)  
- Functions and Recursion  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Pointers (soon!)  
- Pattern Printing  
- Number-based Logic Building
